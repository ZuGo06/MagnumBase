# MagnumBase
To create and edit the database for this course project, a Microsoft SQL Server 2019 database server was selected, 
as well as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for easy graphical database design.
We will use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 integrated development environment to create a client application 
and choose C# based on .NET Framework for Windows Forms GUI as the programming language.
